## Task Details

**What has been published about medical care? What has been published concerning surge capacity and nursing homes? What has been published concerning efforts to inform allocation of scarce resources? What do we know about personal protective equipment? What has been published concerning alternative methods to advise on disease management? What has been published concerning processes of care? What do we know about the clinical characterization and management of the virus?**

Specifically, we want to know what the literature reports about:

- Resources to support skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities.
- Mobilization of surge medical staff to address shortages in overwhelmed communities
- Age-adjusted mortality data for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with/without other organ failure – particularly for viral etiologies
- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) outcomes data of COVID-19 patients
- Outcomes data for COVID-19 after mechanical ventilation adjusted for age.
- Knowledge of the frequency, manifestations, and course of extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, possible cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrest.
- Application of regulatory standards (e.g., EUA, CLIA) and ability to adapt care to crisis standards of care level.
- Approaches for encouraging and facilitating the production of elastomeric respirators, which can save thousands of N95 masks.
- Best telemedicine practices, barriers and faciitators, and specific actions to remove/expand them within and across state boundaries.
- Guidance on the simple things people can do at home to take care of sick people and manage disease.
- Oral medications that might potentially work.
- Use of AI in real-time health care delivery to evaluate interventions, risk factors, and outcomes in a way that could not be done manually.
- Best practices and critical challenges and innovative solutions and technologies in hospital flow and organization, workforce protection, workforce allocation, community-based support resources, payment, and supply chain management to enhance capacity, efficiency, and outcomes.
- Efforts to define the natural history of disease to inform clinical care, public health interventions, infection prevention control, transmission, and clinical trials
- Efforts to develop a core clinical outcome set to maximize usability of data across a range of trials
- Efforts to determine adjunctive and supportive interventions that can improve the clinical outcomes of infected patients (e.g. steroids, high flow oxygen)

## Expected Submission

To be valid, a [submission](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/121068) must be contained in a single notebook made public on or before the submission deadline. Participants are free to use additional datasets in addition to the official Kaggle dataset, but those datasets must also be publicly available on either Kaggle, Allen.ai, or Semantic Scholar in order for the submission to be valid. Participants must also accept the [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form).

## Evaluation

**Submissions will be scored using the following grading rubric:**

- Accuracy (5 points)
  - Did the participant accomplish the task?
  - Did the participant discuss the pros and cons of their approach?
- Documentation (5 points)
  - Is the methodology well documented?
  - Is the code easy to read and reuse?
- Presentation (5 points)
  - Did the participant communicate their findings in an effective manner?
  - Did the participant make effective use of data visualizations?

## Timeline

- Submissions will be evaluated in 2 rounds:
  - Round 1: Submission deadline is April 16, 2020 at 11:59pm UTC. Task Submissions which the evaluation committee deems to meet the threshold criteria will be awarded prizes in this initial round.
  - Round 2: Submission deadline is June 16, 2020 at 11:59pm UTC. The hosts may add prize-eligible tasks in round 2. We may also re-award prizes for existing tasks whose submissions have advanced from the prior award, as judged by the evaluation committee.**

**By each of these submission deadlines, you must have accepted the [rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form) and shared your notebook submission publicly to be considered for prizes in each respective round

## Prizes

- Kaggle is sponsoring a

   

  $1,000 per task

   

  award to the winner who is identified as best meeting the evaluation criteria. The winner may elect to receive this award as a charitable donation to COVID-19 relief/research efforts or as a monetary payment. Some details:

  - Prize-eligible tasks are defined and specified as such on the task by the sponsor and hosts.
  - A team or user is eligible to receive awards for multiple tasks.
  - If the team consists of multiple users, they may elect to divide the monetary prize equally or donate their entire award.
  - Prizes will be distributed in 2 rounds, per details contained in the timeline.
  - Evaluation will be judged by a committee consisting of subject matter experts.
  - All judgments are considered final.
  - Kaggle reserves the right to adjust the prize distribution schedule if needed.

## What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?

COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)

### Task Details

#### What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability? What do we know about natural history, transmission, and diagnostics for the virus? What have we learned about infection prevention and control?

Specifically, we want to know what the literature reports about:

- Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.
- Prevalence of asymptomatic shedding and transmission (e.g., particularly children).
- Seasonality of transmission.
- Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).
- Persistence and stability on a multitude of substrates and sources (e.g., nasal discharge, sputum, urine, fecal matter, blood).
- Persistence of virus on surfaces of different materials (e,g., copper, stainless steel, plastic).
- Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person
- Implementation of diagnostics and products to improve clinical processes
- Disease models, including animal models for infection, disease and transmission
- Tools and studies to monitor phenotypic change and potential adaptation of the virus
- Immune response and immunity
- Effectiveness of movement control strategies to prevent secondary transmission in health care and community settings
- Effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) and its usefulness to reduce risk of transmission in health care and community settings
- Role of the environment in transmission

## Expected Submission

To be valid, a [submission](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/121068) must be contained in a single notebook made public on or before the submission deadline. Participants are free to use additional datasets in addition to the official Kaggle dataset, but those datasets must also be publicly available on either Kaggle, Allen.ai, or Semantic Scholar in order for the submission to be valid. Participants must also accept the [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form).

## Evaluation

**Submissions will be scored using the following grading rubric:**

- Accuracy (5 points)
  - Did the participant accomplish the task?
  - Did the participant discuss the pros and cons of their approach?
- Documentation (5 points)
  - Is the methodology well documented?
  - Is the code easy to read and reuse?
- Presentation (5 points)
  - Did the participant communicate their findings in an effective manner?
  - Did the participant make effective use of data visualizations?

## Timeline

- Submissions will be evaluated in 2 rounds:
  - Round 1: Submission deadline is April 16, 2020 at 11:59pm UTC. Task Submissions which the evaluation committee deems to meet the threshold criteria will be awarded prizes in this initial round.
  - Round 2: Submission deadline is June 16, 2020 at 11:59pm UTC. The hosts may add prize-eligible tasks in round 2. We may also re-award prizes for existing tasks whose submissions have advanced from the prior award, as judged by the evaluation committee.**

**By each of these submission deadlines, you must have accepted the [rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form) and shared your notebook submission publicly to be considered for prizes in each respective round

## Prizes

- Kaggle is sponsoring a

   

  $1,000 per task

   

  award to the winner who is identified as best meeting the evaluation criteria. The winner may elect to receive this award as a charitable donation to COVID-19 relief/research efforts or as a monetary payment. Some details:

  - Prize-eligible tasks are defined and specified as such on the task by the sponsor and hosts.
  - A team or user is eligible to receive awards for multiple tasks.
  - If the team consists of multiple users, they may elect to divide the monetary prize equally or donate their entire award.
  - Prizes will be distributed in 2 rounds, per details contained in the timeline.
  - Evaluation will be judged by a committee consisting of subject matter experts.
  - All judgments are considered final.
  - Kaggle reserves the right to adjust the prize distribution schedule if needed.

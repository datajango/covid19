# What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?

COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)

## Task Details

**What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution? What do we know about the virus origin and management measures at the human-animal interface?**

Specifically, we want to know what the literature reports about:

- Real-time tracking of whole genomes and a mechanism for coordinating the rapid dissemination of that information to inform the development of diagnostics and therapeutics and to track variations of the virus over time.
- Access to geographic and temporal diverse sample sets to understand geographic distribution and genomic differences, and determine whether there is more than one strain in circulation. Multi-lateral agreements such as the Nagoya Protocol could be leveraged.
- Evidence that livestock could be infected (e.g., field surveillance, genetic sequencing, receptor binding) and serve as a reservoir after the epidemic appears to be over.
  - Evidence of whether farmers are infected, and whether farmers could have played a role in the origin.
  - Surveillance of mixed wildlife- livestock farms for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in Southeast Asia.
  - Experimental infections to test host range for this pathogen.
- Animal host(s) and any evidence of continued spill-over to humans
- Socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors for this spill-over
- Sustainable risk reduction strategies

## Expected Submission

To be valid, a [submission](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/121068) must be contained in a single notebook made public on or before the submission deadline. Participants are free to use additional datasets in addition to the official Kaggle dataset, but those datasets must also be publicly available on either Kaggle, Allen.ai, or Semantic Scholar in order for the submission to be valid. Participants must also accept the [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form).

## Evaluation

**Submissions will be scored using the following grading rubric:**

- Accuracy (5 points)
  - Did the participant accomplish the task?
  - Did the participant discuss the pros and cons of their approach?
- Documentation (5 points)
  - Is the methodology well documented?
  - Is the code easy to read and reuse?
- Presentation (5 points)
  - Did the participant communicate their findings in an effective manner?
  - Did the participant make effective use of data visualizations?

## Timeline

- Submissions will be evaluated in 2 rounds:
  - Round 1: Submission deadline is April 16, 2020 at 11:59pm UTC. Task Submissions which the evaluation committee deems to meet the threshold criteria will be awarded prizes in this initial round.
  - Round 2: Submission deadline is June 16, 2020 at 11:59pm UTC. The hosts may add prize-eligible tasks in round 2. We may also re-award prizes for existing tasks whose submissions have advanced from the prior award, as judged by the evaluation committee.**

**By each of these submission deadlines, you must have accepted the [rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form) and shared your notebook submission publicly to be considered for prizes in each respective round

## Prizes

- Kaggle is sponsoring a

   

  $1,000 per task

   

  award to the winner who is identified as best meeting the evaluation criteria. The winner may elect to receive this award as a charitable donation to COVID-19 relief/research efforts or as a monetary payment. Some details:

  - Prize-eligible tasks are defined and specified as such on the task by the sponsor and hosts.
  - A team or user is eligible to receive awards for multiple tasks.
  - If the team consists of multiple users, they may elect to divide the monetary prize equally or donate their entire award.
  - Prizes will be distributed in 2 rounds, per details contained in the timeline.
  - Evaluation will be judged by a committee consisting of subject matter experts.
  - All judgments are considered final.
  - Kaggle reserves the right to adjust the prize distribution schedule if needed.

# What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?

COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)

## Task Details

**What do we know about the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions? What is known about equity and barriers to compliance for non-pharmaceutical interventions?**

Specifically, we want to know what the literature reports about:

- Guidance on ways to scale up NPIs in a more coordinated way (e.g., establish funding, infrastructure and authorities to support real time, authoritative (qualified participants) collaboration with all states to gain consensus on consistent guidance and to mobilize resources to geographic areas where critical shortfalls are identified) to give us time to enhance our health care delivery system capacity to respond to an increase in cases.
- Rapid design and execution of experiments to examine and compare NPIs currently being implemented. DHS Centers for Excellence could potentially be leveraged to conduct these experiments.
- Rapid assessment of the likely efficacy of school closures, travel bans, bans on mass gatherings of various sizes, and other social distancing approaches.
- Methods to control the spread in communities, barriers to compliance and how these vary among different populations..
- Models of potential interventions to predict costs and benefits that take account of such factors as race, income, disability, age, geographic location, immigration status, housing status, employment status, and health insurance status.
- Policy changes necessary to enable the compliance of individuals with limited resources and the underserved with NPIs.
- Research on why people fail to comply with public health advice, even if they want to do so (e.g., social or financial costs may be too high).
- Research on the economic impact of this or any pandemic. This would include identifying policy and programmatic alternatives that lessen/mitigate risks to critical government services, food distribution and supplies, access to critical household supplies, and access to health diagnoses, treatment, and needed care, regardless of ability to pay.

## Expected Submission

To be valid, a [submission](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/121068) must be contained in a single notebook made public on or before the submission deadline. Participants are free to use additional datasets in addition to the official Kaggle dataset, but those datasets must also be publicly available on either Kaggle, Allen.ai, or Semantic Scholar in order for the submission to be valid. Participants must also accept the [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form).

## Evaluation

**Submissions will be scored using the following grading rubric:**

- Accuracy (5 points)
  - Did the participant accomplish the task?
  - Did the participant discuss the pros and cons of their approach?
- Documentation (5 points)
  - Is the methodology well documented?
  - Is the code easy to read and reuse?
- Presentation (5 points)
  - Did the participant communicate their findings in an effective manner?
  - Did the participant make effective use of data visualizations?

## Timeline

- Submissions will be evaluated in 2 rounds:
  - Round 1: Submission deadline is April 16, 2020 at 11:59pm UTC. Task Submissions which the evaluation committee deems to meet the threshold criteria will be awarded prizes in this initial round.
  - Round 2: Submission deadline is June 16, 2020 at 11:59pm UTC. The hosts may add prize-eligible tasks in round 2. We may also re-award prizes for existing tasks whose submissions have advanced from the prior award, as judged by the evaluation committee.**

**By each of these submission deadlines, you must have accepted the [rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form) and shared your notebook submission publicly to be considered for prizes in each respective round

## Prizes

- Kaggle is sponsoring a

   

  $1,000 per task

   

  award to the winner who is identified as best meeting the evaluation criteria. The winner may elect to receive this award as a charitable donation to COVID-19 relief/research efforts or as a monetary payment. Some details:

  - Prize-eligible tasks are defined and specified as such on the task by the sponsor and hosts.
  - A team or user is eligible to receive awards for multiple tasks.
  - If the team consists of multiple users, they may elect to divide the monetary prize equally or donate their entire award.
  - Prizes will be distributed in 2 rounds, per details contained in the timeline.
  - Evaluation will be judged by a committee consisting of subject matter experts.
  - All judgments are considered final.
  - Kaggle reserves the right to adjust the prize distribution schedule if needed.

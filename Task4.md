# Task 4 COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)

## Sample task with sample submission

Help us understand how geography affects virality.

## Research Question

At the time of writing, COVID-19 has spread to at least 114 countries. With viral flu, there are often geographic variations in how the disease will spread and if there are different variations of the virus in different areas. We’d like to explore what the literature and data say about this through this Task.

## Key Sub-Questions

1. Are there geographic variations in the rate of COVID-19 spread?
2. Are there geographic variations in the mortality rate of COVID-19?
3. Is there any evidence to suggest geographic based virus mutations?

## Expected Submission

To be valid, a [submission](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/121068) must be contained in a single notebook made public on or before the submission deadline. Participants are free to use additional datasets in addition to the official Kaggle dataset, but those datasets must also be publicly available on either Kaggle, Allen.ai, or Semantic Scholar in order for the submission to be valid.

This is a sample task. It is not a part of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19). Submissions to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge should use data from the CORD-19 dataset.
